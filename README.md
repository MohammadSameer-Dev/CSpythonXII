# CSpythonXII

> A curated collection of Python (and related) projects, exercises, and notes tailored for 12th-grade Computer Science students (CBSE) — designed to teach core programming concepts through small, well-documented scripts.

---

## Project goal

This repository collects practical, classroom-ready Python examples and small projects that align with typical 12th-grade computer science curricula: data structures, algorithms, file I/O, basic OOP, simple GUI, and problem-solving exercises. The aim is to help students learn by doing, with clear explanations and reproducible examples.

---

## Highlights / example contents

* `basic_programs/` — short programs for fundamentals (loops, conditionals, input/output).
* `data_structures/` — examples using lists, dictionaries, sets, and custom classes.
* `algorithms/` — guided implementations of searching, sorting, recursion, and simple dynamic programming examples.
* `projects/` — slightly larger mini-projects (e.g., CLI todo app, calculator, file-based student record system).
* `gui_examples/` — small Tkinter examples for introducing graphical interfaces.
* `notebooks/` — interactive Jupyter notebooks used for demonstrations and exercises.

---

## Why this repo?

Students and teachers can use the repo as:

* A source of bite-sized examples to demonstrate concepts in class.
* Homework starters: scaffolded projects that students can extend.
* Revision material: clear, commented code to review core topics.

The repository emphasizes readability, comments, and incremental difficulty.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ recommended.
* `pip` for installing optional packages (Jupyter, matplotlib, etc.).

Suggested (optional) packages:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab matplotlib numpy pandas
```

### Running examples

Most examples are plain Python scripts — run them with:

```bash
python path/to/example.py
```

Jupyter notebooks open with:

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you want to add examples or improve documentation:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feature/todo-persistence`).
3. Open a Pull Request describing changes and how to run the new example.

Please keep code readable and commented for students.
